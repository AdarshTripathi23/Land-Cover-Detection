# Land Cover Classification of Satellite Images
**Aidan O'Keefe**


## Overview (Elevator Pitch)
A deep learning (neural network) land cover classification project using satellite images (remote sensing).

Describe the data used in the model
This does not mean that you should list out every single column name and data type. Instead, describe the data generally.
Identify the target
What are you predicting?
Communicate the rationale for predicting this target with this data
This can be very brief. The goal is to avoid a "so what?" response
Evaluate the final model's performance
